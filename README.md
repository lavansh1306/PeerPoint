# DoubtSpark HQ — PeerPoint

Welcome to DoubtSpark HQ (a.k.a. PeerPoint) — the friendly, fast, and focused doubt-solving universe built for SRM students. This repo contains the web app and UI components that power a collaborative learning experience: ask, answer, earn XP, and level up together.

## ✨ What we do

- Connect SRM students so they can ask precise doubts and get helpful answers quickly.
- Reward helpful contributors with XP and leaderboard recognition.
- Provide an intuitive UI for posting questions, commenting, and voting on answers.
- Make the app fast, accessible, and delightful to use — from first load to everyday study sprints.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time-like feed of questions and answers
- XP / leveling and gamified leaderboards
- Profile pages, badges, and achievements
- Lightweight, responsive UI built with React + Tailwind

For a full breakdown of folders and key files, see `STRUCTURE.md` (created alongside this README).

## 🛠️ Quick start

1. Install dependencies (npm/yarn/bun):

```sh
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Notes:
- This project uses Vite + React + TypeScript. If you prefer `yarn` or `bun`, those commands will work too.

## 🧭 Where to look first

- `src/` — app source: pages, components, hooks, and utilities.
- `index.html` — HTML entry, meta tags and og data.
- `vite.config.ts` — Vite configuration and plugins.

See `STRUCTURE.md` for a complete guided tour.
